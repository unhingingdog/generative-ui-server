//! Regression tests for specific, previously-fixed bugs.

/// This test replicates a specific bug found in a real-world scenario.
/// The bug occurred when a delta containing a single closing brace `}` was
/// processed immediately after a large, deeply nested structure.
///
/// The core of the bug was that after the second-to-last object in an array
/// was closed, the parser's state became incorrect, leading to a `Corrupted`
/// error when the next delimiter was processed.
